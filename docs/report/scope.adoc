== Project scope

The expected milestones and goals have been specified in a Google Document written by the Datascientest teamfootnote:[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UEL9wexhETO2MXpxvIPwVRE4WLfLOOi3YF43Zn8L5sk].

Basically the project aims at setting up a full data pipeline that covers the following aspects :

* retrieving data from an external API
* storing that data locally
* ensure it is accessible to potential internal consumers
* consume that data to train a Machine Learning model or display it in a meaningful way
* package and containerise all the code produced to make it reusable and extensible

The data used will be stock market values from various companies.

The overall architecture is outlined in the diagram below ; the yellow blocks within the "OPA Inc." group are to be built within the course of the project and will be presented in the remaining sections.
