== Project scope

This project aims at setting up a full data pipeline that covers the following aspects :

* retrieving data from an external API
* storing that data locally
* ensure it is accessible to potential internal consumers
* consume that data to train a Machine Learning model or display it in a meaningful way
* package and containerise all the code produced to make it reusable and extensible

The data used will be stock market values from various companies.
